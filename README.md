# ZedScripts

This VS Code extension provides comprehensive support for Project Zomboid's [scripts](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Scripts), also known as ZedScripts, including syntax highlighting, auto-formatting, and diagnostics for items, recipes, and other script blocks. This extension is a fork of [pz-syntax-extension](https://github.com/cyberbobjr/pz-syntax-extension) with an almost complete rewrite and many added features, notably the usage of a common data repository.

> [!NOTE]
> This extension is designed specifically for Build 42.

### Features
#### ZedScripts
- Syntax highlighting for Project Zomboid script files.
- Auto-formatting of script files to maintain consistent style.
- Diagnostics for:
  - Common errors in script definitions;
  - Mandatory, wrong, deprecated parameters;
  - Wrong types and values;
  - Missing commas;
  - And more!
- Hovering tooltips with additional information about script elements.
- Auto-completion for script elements based on the Project Zomboid data (automatic mandatory parameters and subblocks).
- Detection for script blocks used in wrong parent blocks.
- Missing IDs detection.
- Last updated Scripts data via the [pz-scripts-data](https://github.com/SirDoggyJvla/pz-scripts-data) repository, which is automatically fetched every 12 hours and cached. Currently needs to be manually actived in the extension settings.

#### TranslationScripts
> [!WARNING]  
> This feature is now deprecated and only kept for pre-42.15 translation files, as now those use JSON. It will be deleted when the last version supporting pre-42.15 will no longer be supported.
- Translation files syntax highlighting and diagnostics.

### Usage
- Install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace.
- Open a `.txt` script file.
- Press Ctrl + Shift + P and select "Change Language Mode".
- Choose from the list one of the following languages:
  - "ZedScripts" for scripts files
  - "TranslationScripts" for translation files

You can set the extension to automatically downloads the latest script data from the [pz-scripts-data](https://github.com/SirDoggyJvla/pz-scripts-data) repository via the extension settings, it will cache the data for 12 hours, which it will fetch once more after this time. If it doesn't manage to fetch this data, it will fall back to the bundled data with the extension, which may get outdated until the next update.

You can fetch data manually by running the command "ZedScripts: Force fetch Scripts Data" from the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P). This won't directly update the diagnostics (due to a bug to fix, see [issue #2](https://github.com/SirDoggyJvla/ZedScripts/issues/2)) so you will have to restart VSCode.

### Configuration
By default the Project Zomboid directory is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ProjectZomboid\media\scripts`, but you can change this in the settings of the extension. The extension automatically retrieves the vanilla item scripts. However this is a part of the old code I've yet to touch, so I do not know how well it works.

You can disable a specific diagnostic by adding its ID to the `zedScripts.disabledDiagnostics` setting. Alternatively, you can disable all diagnostics via the `zedScripts.disableAllDiagnostics` setting. Below are all the available diagnostics for scripts:

| ID                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |

### Changelog
With each update, the extension fetches the latest data from the pz-scripts-data repository and make a local copy of it. If you're having issues, it might be because of outdated data, so make sure to fetch the latest data.

1.9.5:
- better deprecated parameter diagnostic handling. It now indicates the version, the replacement parameter if any, and a description which explains the deprecation
- added quick fixes for some diagnostics. Currently only for: deprecated parameter with replacement, missing comma and wrong comma format
- tweaked the highlight of blocks

1.9.4:
- swap config for forced local data to true by default, since the extension is actively being developped and worked on, should reduce problems when the format changes for the data

1.9.3:
- improved the logo
- added tests for script files identification to run
- add diagnostics for dependent parameters and type (parameters that require another parameter to be present with a specific value)
- improved handling for types of parameters
- adjusted parameter-value combo identification to take `//` comments in the parameter name since those are not valid for scripts
- added some script blocks to be ignored for parsing
- implemented handling for optional ID for blocks
- added a link to the [ScriptsDocs](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/ScriptsDocs) in the hovering of blocks and parameters
- fix hovering showing description and wiki page link for unrecognized parameters
- fix small mistake which made some wiki page links broken

1.9.2:
- patched any file being marked as a script file by default

1.9.1:
- properly handle comments /* */ in script files now by replacing them with whitespaces before parsing, which allows to keep the correct character positions for diagnostics and syntax highlighting

1.9.0:
- update to new document files "ROOT-" files from pz-scripts-data
- improved diagnostics for script files by splitting their handling into different document block types. This allows for specific parameters and child blocks to be defined for each document types (sandbox-options.txt, mod.info, generic script files and more)
- now properly detects script files for automatic language activation
- fixed some syntax highlighting and diagnostic issues for script blocks

1.8.1:
- fix missing changelog

1.8.0:
- added a master switch to disable all diagnostics at once
- added ability to disable specific diagnostics via configuration

1.7.1:
- minor handling tweaks for the file activation
- force translation data to use an old copy of the translation data which dates pre-42.15, and force fetch to retrieve from an old copy from the new translation files dataset
